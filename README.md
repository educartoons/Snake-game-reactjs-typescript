# Snake Game

The classic Snake Game implemented in ReactJS with Typescript

## Tools

For developing the Snake Game I used the next tools:

- **ReactJS** with Typescript
- **Context** to keep the global state of the game and the business logic separated from the presentational layer
- **TailwindCSS** to style the components
- **Vite** for building a development environment for ReactJS
- **pnpm** to manage node package modules

## Todo

- [ ] Increasing the velocity of displacemente of the Snake when it increases its length
- [ ] Add rules when the snake impacts out of the grid
- [ ] Add rules when the snake impacts itself
- [ ] Add a display message when the user lost the game
